# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project aims to build a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms. The model leverages a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The dataset contains synthetic fraud transaction data, which has been preprocessed and cleaned for better feature extraction and model accuracy. The system calculates the probability of a transaction being fraudulent, making it useful for real-time fraud detection in financial applications.
